    <h2>What are the Pyramids of Giza</h2>
    <p>
      The three Pyramids of Giza were built as tombs by three kings (or
      Pharaohs) of ancient Egypt. They were constructed on the Giza plateau
      during the fourth dynasty of Ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom by the Pharaohs
      Khufu, his son Khafre, and Menkaure, son of Khafre. The Giza plateau
      also has many other smaller pyramids and temples, as well as monuments
      like the Great Sphinx of Giza.
    </p>
    <h2>Who Built Pyramids of Giza</h2>
    <p>
      Anceint Egypt. The first pyramidwas built by Pharaoh Kufu around 2550
      BC. Kufu's pyramid is also known as Great Pyramid, and it's the largest
      among the three, with an imposing height of 146.5 meters. It stood as
      the tallest structure in the world for nearly 3800 years. It took around
      20 years to complete, and it's still unknown how Egyptians pulled off a
      massive construction. The second pyramid was built for Pharaoh Khafre,
      son of Khufu. The construction of this pyramid, and the Great Sphinx,
      began around 2520 BC. The third, and smallest, pyramid was built during
      the reign of Pharaoh Menkaure and was completed around 2510 BC.

    <h2>History of Pyramids of Giza in Nutshell</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu began construction of the Great Pyramids of
        Giza in the 26th century BC, and it was completed around c. 2560 BC.
      </li>
      <li>
        Khufu’s successors, Khafre and Menkaure build their own pyramids at
        Giza between c. 2570 and 2500 BC.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Pyramids were looted by grave robbers during ancient times, but
        later Pharaohs renewed the site and added new structures at the
        complex.
      </li>
      <li>During the Roman Empire, Giza became a popular tourist site.</li>
      <li>
        Under the medieval Islamic Caliphs of Cairo, explorations were
        undertaken. But in In 1196 AD, Al-Aziz Uthman tried to destroy the
        pyramids.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the French invasion of Egypt in 1798, early egyptologists
        studies the Pyramids,
      </li>
      <li>
        From the 1920s onwards, modern Egyptologists have made valuable
        discoveries about the pyramids.

  </section>
  <section class="section section-2">
    <h2>The Great Wall of China</h2>
    <p>
      The Great Wall of China  is a series of fortifications that were built across the
      historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China
      as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.
      Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with
      selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the
      first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on,
      many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of
      border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming
      dynasty (1368–1644). Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great
      Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on
      goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of
      trade and the control of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the
      defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the
      construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations,
      signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact
      that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation
      corridor. The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple
      courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop
      Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north
      to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates
      the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi)
      in total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is
      generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats
      in history.

  </section>
  <section class="section section-3">
    <h2>Petra</h2>
    <p>
      Petra is a historic and archaeological city in
      southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a
      basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah
      valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[5] The area
      around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[6] and the
      Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of
      their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.[7] Archaeological work has
      only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second
      century BC,[8] by which time Petra had become their capital.[6] The
      Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the
      incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading
      hub.[6][9] The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable
      revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. Unlike their
      enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts
      and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's
      mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting
      rainwater, agriculture, and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st
      century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure – believed to be the mausoleum
      of Nabataean king Aretas IV – was constructed, and its population peaked
      at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[10] Although the Nabataean kingdom
      became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC, it
      was only in 106 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the
      Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia Petraea.[11]
      Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an
      earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era,
      several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline
      and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of
      nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss
      traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it

  </section>
  <section class="section section-4">
    <h2>Colosseum</h2>
    <p>
      The Colosseum  is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of
      Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
      amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre
      in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor
      Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD under his
      successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were made
      during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors who were
      patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the
      amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum
      Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later
      classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family
      name (Flavius). The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff
      (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated
      50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5]
      having an average audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for
      gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts,
      executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman
      mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used
      for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for
      such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a
      fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine. Although substantially
      ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is
      still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the
      New 7 Wonders of the World.[7] It is one of Rome's most popular tourist
      attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each
      Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that
      starts in the area around the Colosseum.[8] The Colosseum is depicted on
      the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.

  <section class="section section-5">
    <h2>Chichen Itza</h2>
    <p>
      Chichén Itzá was a large pre-Columbian city built by the
      Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is
      located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1] Chichén Itzá
      was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late
      Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and
      into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The
      site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles
      seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern
      Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought
      to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from
      central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence
      of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.
      Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to
      have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in
      later Mesoamerican literature.[2] The city may have had the most diverse
      population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to
      the variety of architectural styles at the site

  <section class="section section-6">
    <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
    <p>
      Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern
      Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain
      ridge.[2][3] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is
      the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the
      Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province[4] above the Sacred
      Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba
      River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a
      canyon with a tropical mountain climate.[5] In reference to the site’s
      name, for most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu
      is silent.  
      Inca civilization had no written language and no European visited the
      site until the 19th century, so far as is known, so there are no written
      records of the site while it was in use. The names of the buildings,
      their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are the product of modern
      archaeologists on the basis of physical evidence, including tombs at the
      site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished
      dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the
      Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the
      outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors a
      better idea of how they originally appeared.[11] By 1976, 30% of Machu
      Picchu had been restored[11] and restoration continues.[12] Most recent
      archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate
      for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). The Incas built the estate
      around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of the Spanish
      conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied
      from c. 1420–1532.[13] Historical research published in 2022 claims that
      the site was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca people
      themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name

  <section class="section section-7">
    <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p>
      The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank
      of the rive in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned
      in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house
      the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of
      Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
      (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set
      in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
      Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but
      work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The
      Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in
      1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in
      2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion.[7] The construction project
      employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of
      architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect.
      Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect
      natural beauty and divinity. The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO
      World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India
      and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's
      heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal
      architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal
      attracts 7-8 million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a
      winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
